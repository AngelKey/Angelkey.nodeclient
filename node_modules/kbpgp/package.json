We can then discuss it post-mortem. To reach us privately, please get our public keys here:\n\n  - https://keybase.io/max\n  - https://keybase.io/chris\n  \nYou can import our keys to GPG - and verify our Keybase.io admin status - with `keybase track max` and `keybase track chris`.\n\n### Other bugs, issues, comments, questions, and suggestions\n\nIf the bug is kbpgp related, and has nothing to do with Keybase, you can post the issue here. If it has anything to do with Keybase -- the command line client, website, etc. -- please post it in our general [keybase issues](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues) repo:\n\n  - https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues\n\nWe appreciate comments, questions, feature requests, etc.\n\n#### Thanks!\n\n  - https://keybase.io/max\n  - https://keybase.io/chris\n",
